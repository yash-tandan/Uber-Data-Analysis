# Uber_data_analysis
Well in this Project we need find out the reason for the Uber cabs getting cancelled with provieded data sets
Data set: kaggle (offical relese of Uber data)

problem statement:

You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars?

Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars to and from the airport) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of the analysis, we should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them

In this Project we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis on Uber Request data

so we proceed with the project in sequce as data cleaning then we perform Univariate analysis where we take one variable from data set and we go in deep analaysis of that varibale 

then we look for Bivaraite analysis and draw our conclusion

Conclusions : Based on the data analysis performed, following recommendation can be used by Uber to bridge the gap between supply and demand: -

For bridging the demand supply gap from airport to city, making a permanent stand in the airport itself where the cabs will be available at all times and the incomplete requests can come down significantly.

Uber can provide some incentives to the driver who complete the trip from city to airport in the morning part. This might result the driver to not cancel the request from city to airport trips.

Last but sure solution to bring down the gap is to increase the numbers of cab in its fleet.
